            <h1>Biography of mahatma gandhi</h1>
            <h4>Mahatma Gandhi was a beacon of hope and an embodiment of nonviolence during India's struggle for independence. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, he would go on to become one of the most influential figures in the world.

Gandhi's journey was marked by a commitment to truth, justice, and compassion. He coined the term "Satyagraha," which means "truth-force" or "soul-force," and he led India in its fight for freedom through nonviolent civil disobedience. His principles of nonviolence and civil resistance inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the globe.</h4>

<h4>As a lawyer, he traveled to South Africa, where he first experienced the deep-rooted discrimination against Indians. This experience ignited the fire within him to fight against injustice and inequality. He returned to India in 1915 and quickly became the leader of the Indian National Congress, advocating for self-reliance and non-cooperation with British rule.

One of his most iconic actions was the Salt March in 1930, where he and thousands of followers walked for over 240 miles to the Arabian Sea to produce their own salt, defying British salt taxes. This peaceful protest drew international attention and strengthened the resolve of the Indian independence movement.</h4>

<h4>Gandhi's commitment to nonviolence was unwavering, even in the face of adversity. His principles of truth, nonviolence, and civil disobedience inspired not only the people of India but also leaders and activists worldwide. He believed that "an eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind."

Sadly, on January 30, 1948, this great soul was assassinated by a fanatic, but his legacy continues to shine brightly. Mahatma Gandhi's life and teachings remain an inspiration for all those who seek justice, equality, and a world free from violence.</h4>

<h3>Today, we remember and pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the "Father of the Nation" in India and a symbol of peace and freedom for the world.</h3>
